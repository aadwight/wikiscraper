This project was completed as a coding exercise.

The project requirements can be found in requirements.txt.

I spent about 2 hours on this.

  00:00 -   10:00: thinking about problem
  10:00 -   20:00: project setup & boilerplate
  20:00 - 1:20:00: scraping website
1:20:00 - 1:45:00: implemented API
1:45:00 - 2:00:00: cleanup and documentation

These are some of the things I would do for a real project if I were to spend more time:

- Implement security
- Store values in a db instead of in memory
- Handle errors more gracefully
- Better documentation
- More endpoints
- Better unit tests
- Consider alternatives to JSoup
